## Motivation

The opioid epidemic is a national crisis. Every day in the U.S., more than 130 people die from an opioid overdose. The importance of finding a solution to the opioid epidemic is indisputable.  
  
In this project, we aim to explore trends in the opioid crisis from a demographic standpoint, as well as to investigate the effectiveness of different public health and policy efforts. Through this data-grounded exploration, we hope to elucidate the role that public health can play in alleviating the epidemic.

## Data

  **amfAR Data: [Distance to Treatment Facility](<https://opioid.amfar.org/about/sources>)**
    amfAR is a non-profit which publishes data related to the HIV epidemic. The data set we utilized contains the average distance from each county to an opioid related treatment facility. 
    
  **New York State Health Data: [Opioid related Treatments and Deaths](<https://health.data.ny.gov>)**
    This data set details opioid related treatments from, including both inpatient and outpatient treatment for opioid diagnoses from 2010 to 2015. The data is then categorized by county, year, whether the county is urban or rural, and the insurance of the patient. An additional data set in the New York health data which included the number of opioid related deaths from 2003 to 2017 was also utilized. 
  
  **ARCOS Data: [Pills Perscribed by County](<https://github.com/wpinvestigative/arcos-api>)**
    The ARCOS data set is published by the Washington Post as part of a database which tracks opioid perscriptions from manufacturer to patient between 2006 and 2012. We utilized the data related to the number of pills perscribed to patients in each U.S. county, filtering for the counties in New York state. 
    
  **Government Data: [Medication Take-Back Facilites](<https://catalog.data.gov/>)**
    Finally, we used govenment data which provided the location of medication take-back facilities. This data was limited to counties in New York state, and the distance was mapped against opioid related deaths and treatments. The medication take-back facility data was collected in 2017.

## Research Questions

* How do opioid deaths change over time in the following categories:

  * Race
  
  * Age
  
  * Gender
  
  * Rural/Urban

* How does the type of insurance a person has relate to the number of opioid-related facility visits?

* How do opioid related treatment visits and deaths differ by county?

* How do the number of pills prescribed differ by county over time?

## Findings

We found several interesting demographic patterns and other trends in our data. 45-54 year olds had the largest number of deaths from 2003 to 2013. However, from 2014 to 2017, 25-34 year olds have seen a sharp increase in death count, surpassing 45-54 year olds by a large margain. 

We find that death counts by race/ethnicity have maintained a very similar distribution from 2003 to 2013. Whites have by far the largest number of deaths, followed by Hispanic and Black populations. 

From 2003 to 2013, men have double or more the number of deaths as compared to females. Death counts among men have grown exponentially since 2014, while female numbers have remained relatively similar. 

There is not a distinct difference between opioid death rate per 10,000 in rural vs urban communities. However, we do see a slight increasng trend in urban deaths between 2010 and 2012.

Suffolk county consistently has the highest number of opioid related treatment visits, and number of pills prescribed. When adjusted for population size, Sullivan county has the highest rate of opioid-related death.
