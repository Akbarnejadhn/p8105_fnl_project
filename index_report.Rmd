# Initial questions

When investigating our datasets described below, we were primarily interested in urban vs rural communities as they related to opioid deaths. We were also interested in the county-level differences within New York, particularly because the state has such variety. Manhattan is very different from somewhere upstate, like Albany. We thought it would be interesting to consider the trends in pill prescription of different counties. Additionally, we wanted to look into opioid-related treatment visits in the counties in New York.

As the project evolved, we became curious about more individual-level data as well as the county level data described above. We thought that investigating demographics could provide insight into the opioid epidemic in New York. This led to questions about whether or not opioid deaths change over time with respect to race, age, or gender. Finally, we wanted to know if the type of insurance a person had related to the number of opioid-related facility visits. For example, were there more visits paid for by Medicare vs Medicaid? 

_Our final research questions were as follows:_

* How do opioid deaths change over time in the following categories:

  * Race
  
  * Age
  
  * Gender
  
  * Rural/Urban

* How does the type of insurance a person has relate to the number of opioid-related facility visits?

* How do opioid related treatment visits and deaths differ by county?

* How do the number of pills prescribed differ by county over time?

# Data
Source, scraping method, cleaning, etc.


# Exploratory analysis
Visualizations, summaries, and exploratory statistical analyses. Justify the steps you took, and show any major changes to your ideas.


# Additional analysis

We conducted additional analysis on our data using model building techniques and clustering. The process

of model building included a stepwise regression on the parameters included in our data. VIF scores were

checked for multicollinearity in our variables. Finally, a simple model was proposed and then stepwise

regression was conducted to check for significance of the variables. A simple model was compared to the

complex model and determined to be preferable. 

Model building is a useful tool for prediction and inference. The types of models we used in this

analysis can be used for inference. Further analysis including cross validation or bootstrapping could

test the final model against future random samples to determine its predictive ability.

Clustering is a statistical tool that groups observations by location. For the purposes of this project

counties were grouped by the intercepts and slopes collected from linear models of various

opioid-related data adjusted for county population over time. These graphs indicate which counties might

have similar trends, for instance in order to apply available public health treatments in groups of

populations. Basically, there were some counties that started low and didn't change much, some that

started high and didn't change much, and some started in the middle and rose higher with time.

# Discussion: What were your findings? Are they what you expect? What insights into the data can you make?
