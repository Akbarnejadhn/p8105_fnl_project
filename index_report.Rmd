# Initial questions
What questions are you trying to answer? How did these questions evolve over the course of the project? What new questions did you consider in the course of your analysis?


# Data
Source, scraping method, cleaning, etc.


# Exploratory analysis
Visualizations, summaries, and exploratory statistical analyses. Justify the steps you took, and show any major changes to your ideas.


# Additional analysis

We conducted additional analysis on our data using model building techniques and clustering. The process

of model building included a stepwise regression on the parameters included in our data. VIF scores were

checked for multicollinearity in our variables. Finally, a simple model was proposed and then stepwise

regression was conducted to check for significance of the variables. A simple model was compared to the

complex model and determined to be preferable. 

Model building is a useful tool for prediction and inference. The types of models we used in this

analysis can be used for inference. Further analysis including cross validation or bootstrapping could

test the final model against future random samples to determine its predictive ability.

Clustering is a statistical tool that groups observations by location. For the purposes of this project

counties were grouped by the intercepts and slopes collected from linear models of various

opioid-related data adjusted for county population over time. These graphs indicate which counties might

have similar trends, for instance in order to apply available public health treatments in groups of

populations. Basically, there were some counties that started low and didn't change much, some that

started high and didn't change much, and some started in the middle and rose higher with time.

# Discussion: What were your findings? Are they what you expect? What insights into the data can you make?

Opioid related injuries included in our data sets were measured by emergency room visits, deaths, and

inpatient treatment. The number of opioids bought by pharmacies in each county was used as a proxy for

the number of pills sold in each county. There were demographic data available for deaths by opioid

overdose in New York City including the age group, race/ethnicity and gender of each subject.

A rural/urban variable was included in one dataset. We drew on this information to make our findings. 

Opioid overdose in New York City affect white people more than people of other races/ethnicities, and

more men as compared to women. Opioid overdose also tends to affect young adults (ages 25-34) more than

any other age group.

One finding that was not expected was that there was no apparent difference between rural and urban 

areas. This indicates that indicators associated with the urban/rural gradient, such as population 

density, may not have much effect on the prevalence of opioid related injuries. 

However, there was an association between the number of opioid related deaths in New York City

as compared with the rest of New York State when adjusting for the number of pills bought in each

county. So, this could be evidence that different interventions may be necessary to prevent opioid 

related injuries in counties outside the five boroughs. 

There were also statistical learning methods included. So, there was a search for trends in the data

that were not known. While there is an association between the pills bought per capita and the 

opioid deaths per 10,000 people, it may not be safe to assume that reducing opioid prescriptions would

decrease opioid injuries. Clustering counties by trends in the number of opioid related emergency room visits, 

opioid overdoses, and pills prescribed can reveal patterns that may be useful for deciding where and

how to distribute public health resources.
