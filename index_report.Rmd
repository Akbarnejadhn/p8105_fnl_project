# We can include the report here (?)

# Motivation
**Provide an overview of the project goals and motivation.**
Given this, our goal in this project was to find out whether there is any meaningful information about demographics of people who were affected by opioid overdose. For instance, if certain age groups, gender, racial groups, or living condition accompanies with higher rates of opioid-related death in New York City. Also, we were interested in learning more about how these trends change over the years. We also look for any significant and meaningful information about the number of Emergency Room visits, the number of opioid-related death, and the number of pills prescribed to see if there is any meaningful and significant relationship between the different counties of New York City.

# Initial questions
What questions are you trying to answer? How did these questions evolve over the course of the project? What new questions did you consider in the course of your analysis?


# Data
Source, scraping method, cleaning, etc.


# Exploratory analysis
Visualizations, summaries, and exploratory statistical analyses. Justify the steps you took, and show any major changes to your ideas.


# Additional analysis

We conducted additional analysis on our data using model building techniques and clustering. The process

of model building included a stepwise regression on the parameters included in our data. VIF scores were

checked for multicollinearity in our variables. Finally, a simple model was proposed and then stepwise

regression was conducted to check for significance of the variables. A simple model was compared to the

complex model and determined to be preferable. 

Model building is a useful tool for prediction and inference. The types of models we used in this

analysis can be used for inference. Further analysis including cross validation or bootstrapping could

test the final model against future random samples to determine its predictive ability.

Clustering is a statistical tool that groups observations by location. For the purposes of this project

counties were grouped by the intercepts and slopes collected from linear models of various

opioid-related data adjusted for county population over time. These graphs indicate which counties might

have similar trends, for instance in order to apply available public health treatments in groups of

populations. Basically, there were some counties that started low and didn't change much, some that

started high and didn't change much, and some started in the middle and rose higher with time.

# Discussion: What were your findings? Are they what you expect? What insights into the data can you make?
