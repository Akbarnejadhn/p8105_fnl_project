# Motivation

_"Opioids kill more people each year than traffic accidents, than guns. Increasingly, they're killing children. New synthetic drugs are emerging -- cocktails so potent even touching them can lead to injury or death..."_

The United States has been experiencing its most death-dealing drug overdose epidemic that had charged with prescription painkillers and an increased use of street drugs such as heroin and illicit fentanyl. This crisis has reached a point that it not only affecting adolescence, but also it is affecting the generation of babies that get born. According to the White House, _"The number of babies born drug-dependent increased by 500 percent between 2000 and 2014. Almost a third of all children placed in foster care are from families with parental drug abuse"_
â€“ spurring unprecedented bipartisan efforts throughout the nation to combat opioid abuse.


Comparing data from New York City, we can see that in 2017, the rate of opioid-involving deaths was 16.1 deaths per 100,000 persons compared to the average national rate of 14.6 deaths per 100,000 persons. Someone dies of a drug overdose every 7 hours, and 82 percent of the 1,374 overdose deaths in 2016 were from an opioid. As an overview, the following maps show the number of drug related deaths, as well as the number of opioid prescriptions in different counties.

The aforementioned figures lead us to focus on the aspects of this crisis in NYC counties. Our goal is to find out any meaningful trends in demographics of people who were affected by opioid overdose in New York City. For instance can we see any alerting trends in certain age groups, gender, or racial groups? How do these trends change over the years? Also, historically, we know that drug epidemics have been mostly limited to cities, but it is interesting to know that there have been opioid overdoses spikes taking place in suburban and rural areas, recently. So, we also want to investigate the difference of opioid-related death in urban and rural areas. We also wanted to explore the number of Emergency Room visits, the number of opioid-related death, and the number of pills prescribed to see if there is any meaningful and significant relationship between the different counties of New York City. We hope that through this exploration, we can elucidate the role that public health can play in allaying this deadly, fast-growing epidemic.

# Initial Questions

When investigating our datasets described below, we were primarily interested in urban vs rural communities as they related to opioid deaths. We were also interested in the county-level differences within New York, particularly because the state has such variety. Manhattan is very different from somewhere upstate, like Albany. We thought it would be interesting to consider the trends in pill prescription of different counties. Additionally, we wanted to look into opioid-related treatment visits in the counties in New York.

As the project evolved, we became curious about more individual-level data as well as the county level data described above. We thought that investigating demographics could provide insight into the opioid epidemic in New York. This led to questions about whether or not opioid deaths change over time with respect to race, age, or gender. Finally, we wanted to know if the type of insurance a person had related to the number of opioid-related facility visits. For example, were there more visits paid for by Medicare vs Medicaid?

_Our final research questions were as follows:_

* How do opioid deaths change over time in the following categories:

  * Race

  * Age

  * Gender

  * Rural/Urban

* How does the type of insurance a person has relate to the number of opioid-related facility visits?

* How do opioid related treatment visits and deaths differ by county?

* How do the number of pills prescribed differ by county over time?

# Data #
  
  **amfAR Data: [Distance to Treatment Facility](<https://opioid.amfar.org/about/sources>)**
    amfAR is a non-profit which publishes data related to the HIV epidemic. The data set we utilized contains the average distance from each county to an opioid related treatment facility. 
    
  **New York State Health Data: [Opioid related Treatments and Deaths](<https://health.data.ny.gov>)**
    This data set details opioid related treatments from, including both inpatient and outpatient treatment for opioid diagnoses from 2010 to 2015. The data is then categorized by county, year, whether the county is urban or rural, and the insurance of the patient. An additional data set in the New York health data which included the number of opioid related deaths from 2003 to 2017 was also utilized. 
  
  **ARCOS Data: [Pills Perscribed by County](<https://github.com/wpinvestigative/arcos-api>)**
    The ARCOS data set is published by the Washington Post as part of a database which tracks opioid perscriptions from manufacturer to patient between 2006 and 2012. We utilized the data related to the number of pills perscribed to patients in each U.S. county, filtering for the counties in New York state. 
    
  **Government Data: [Medication Take-Back Facilites](<https://catalog.data.gov/>)**
    Finally, we used govenment data which provided the location of medication take-back facilities. This data was limited to counties in New York state, and the distance was mapped against opioid related deaths and treatments. The medication take-back facility data was collected in 2017.  


# Exploratory Analysis
Visualizations, summaries, and exploratory statistical analyses. Justify the steps you took, and show any major changes to your ideas.


# Additional Analysis

We conducted additional analysis on our data using model building techniques and clustering. The process of model building included a stepwise regression on the parameters included in our data. VIF scores were checked for multicollinearity in our variables. Finally, a simple model was proposed and then stepwise regression was conducted to check for significance of the variables. A simple model was compared to the complex model and determined to be preferable. 

Model building is a useful tool for prediction and inference. The types of models we used in this analysis can be used for inference. Further analysis including cross validation or bootstrapping could test the final model against future random samples to determine its predictive ability. Clustering is a statistical tool that groups observations by location. For the purposes of this project counties were grouped by the intercepts and slopes collected from linear models of various opioid-related data adjusted for county population over time. These graphs indicate which counties might have similar trends, for instance in order to apply available public health treatments in groups of populations. Basically, there were some counties that started low and didn't change much, some that started high and didn't change much, and some started in the middle and rose higher with time.

# Discussion

Opioid related injuries included in our data sets were measured by emergency room visits, deaths, and inpatient treatment. The number of opioids bought by pharmacies in each county was used as a proxy for the number of pills sold in each county. There were demographic data available for deaths by opioid overdose in New York City including the age group, race/ethnicity and gender of each subject. A rural/urban variable was included in one dataset. We drew on this information to make our findings. Opioid overdose in New York City affect white people more than people of other races/ethnicities, and more men as compared to women. Opioid overdose also tends to affect young adults (ages 25-34) more than any other age group.

One finding that was not expected was that there was no apparent difference between rural and urban areas. This indicates that indicators associated with the urban/rural gradient, such as population density, may not have much effect on the prevalence of opioid related injuries. However, there was an association between the number of opioid related deaths in New York City as compared with the rest of New York State when adjusting for the number of pills bought in each county. So, this could be evidence that different interventions may be necessary to prevent opioid related injuries in counties outside the five boroughs. There were also statistical learning methods included. So, there was a search for trends in the data that were not known. While there is an association between the pills bought per capita and the opioid deaths per 10,000 people, it may not be safe to assume that reducing opioid prescriptions would decrease opioid injuries. Clustering counties by trends in the number of opioid related emergency room visits, opioid overdoses, and pills prescribed can reveal patterns that may be useful for deciding where and how to distribute public health resources.

Additionally, as discussed in the _Exploratory Analysis_ section, we looked at the relationship between gross number of deaths and distance to the nearest treatment facility. We see a decreasing relationship between number of deaths and distance to nearest treatment facility. In other words, the closer a county is to a treatment facility, the more deaths occur in that county. However, when we adjust for population and look at a rate of deaths, this relationship no longer holds. This makes sense, because places with a larger population probably have a shorter distance to treatment facility. 

As mentioned in the _Aditional Analysis_ section, there are some public health implications that can be taken from our findings. The information for which populations have the most deaths could provide insight for different initiatives. For instance, programs may benefit from targeting men specifically as they are in a higher risk group. Additionally, there appears to be a slight linear relationship between pills bought per person and opioid-related deaths. This may suggest that prescribing fewer pills could help decrease the number of opioid-related deaths in NY.
